# Databases Project

# Name of the project

I suppose I will call this NEU Co-op Drug Testing Database.

# Name of the team(s). At most two teams per project. One from each section, if applicable

My team/group is Database Deisgn 51 on Canvas. It is just me.

# Team members and the section they belong to. At most 4 team members per project

Just me: Kyle Smith Section 04

# Brief description of the project

My project is designed to help Northeastern Students share information on whether or not different co-op employers drug test as part of an employment screening. Students can share or view entries of this information that are assigned to a specific company, which can also be created. 

You can see an alternative version of this idea I completed for my WebDev class: http://blazeneu.com/ (although I wrote all independent code for this project.)

To implement this, I used a Postgres database, and elixir through the Phoenix framework to handle all the interaction. All the front end is written in an HTML/elixir integration.
